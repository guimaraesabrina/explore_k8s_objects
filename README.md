## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **`/images`**: Contains visual resources related to Kubernetes objects. For example, `redes-kubernetes.png` illustrates how Kubernetes networking interfaces with various objects.

- **`/objects`**: Each subdirectory within `objects` is dedicated to a specific Kubernetes object type. Here, you will find a README.md in each subdirectory providing detailed documentation and use case examples for each object type:
  - `configmap`
  - `deployment`
  - `job`
  - `pod`
  - `replicaset`
  - `secret`
  - `service`
  - `statefulset`

- **`/practical`**: Contains hands-on practical exercises to apply what you've learned. These are divided into different sessions:
  - `practical_001`: Focuses on deployments, pods, and replicasets.
  - `practical_002`: Continues with more advanced scenarios involving deployments and pods.
